# MLS_PDFproject
This project to pull the PDFs from the MLS database and see if residential housing prices are being affected by the Coronavirus pandemic. This code reads the MLS PDFs and pulls the sold price, and any concessions (if there are any), then compares it as a percentage, and produces a chart.
